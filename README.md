# IntervalBoxes.jl

[![Build Status](https://github.com/dpsanders/IntervalBoxes.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/dpsanders/IntervalBoxes.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)


Multi-dimensional interval boxes in Julia.

These are Cartesian products of `Interval`s (actually `BareInterval`s) defined in [IntervalArithmetic.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/IntervalArithmetic.jl).

[This code was originally in that repo but was removed. The git history can be found there.]
